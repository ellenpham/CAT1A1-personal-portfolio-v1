                            I am always fascinated about how technology has evolved and how amazing applications and programs are created to serve us in daily life. 
                            That is why I start coding, I want to be a part of the tech industry, contribute to create real programs that solve real-world problems.
                            I love the feelings when seeing my codes turn into actual products or when I figure out a solution or just simply being able to debug. I call them my "Eureka" coding moments!</p> 
                        <p id="para2">Currently a boot-camper at Coder Academy, I strive to expand my tech knowledge and sharpen my coding skills. 
                            I always put in 100% effort in all of my projects. 
                            To me, no project is less significant, because there is no single solution for a coding challenge. I can always learn something from exploring different approaches. </p>

            <div class="story1">
                <p>Back in 2017, I worked in marketing data management team at Bosch, Singapore. In 2019, I moved back to Australia and worked as a resourcing specialist at Programmed Skilled Workforce.
                My love for technology and the confidence working with systems gradually grew throughout years of performing database management and data analysis. Yet, I still found the job was not challenging enough.
                In 2020, I had my first child. Being a mother gives me the strength and motivation to build myself a career that is flexible enough to achieve work-life balance.
                <br><br>I then took my courage and leapt into the new found passion - <strong><em>coding</em></strong>.
                I love combining the worlds of logic and creative design to make <em>engaging</em>, <em>functional</em> and <em>accessible</em> websites and applications. Above all, I strive to deliver meaningful storytelling through digital experience.
                <br><br> Here I quoted my favorite saying from Maya Angelou. Switching to tech career as a female/mother is not easy but I believe that as long as you put your heart in whatever you do, work hard and never give up, you will get rewarded with fruitful outcome.
                <br><br> I truly hope one day I can inspire and encourage young mothers to take the leap and get educated in this fast-changing world of technology. And that one day my kids could proudly say that "My mom is a coder".

            <div class="story2">
                <p>Me, when I am not coding, might be not like any coders you might think of. 
                I am a yoga lover, a plants addict, an aspiring chef and a spiritual enthusiast.
                I am mindful in everything I do and find my happiness in the givings.
                I bring those mindset into my projects and aim for human-centered digital products that serve and connect to users.
                <br><br> That also makes me a team-oriented person, I communicate and collaborate with peers with dedication and respect. 
                I keep an open mind when it comes to reaching out for assistance and clarifying my questions.
                By myself, I learn and work diligently to support the team achieve common goals.
