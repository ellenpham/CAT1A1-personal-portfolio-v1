                        <p id="para1">I am a full-stack developer, based in Melbourne, Australia. 
                            I have been always fascinated about how technology has evolved and changed the world, also curious about how amazing applications and programs are created to serve us in daily life. 
                            That is why I start coding, I want to be a part of the tech industry, contribute to create real programs that solve real-world problems.
                            I love the feelings when seeing my codes turn into actual products or when I figure out a solution or just simply being able to debug. I call them my "Eureka" coding moments!</p> 
                        <p id="para2">Currently a boot-camper at Coder Academy, I strive every day to expand my tech knowledge and sharpen my coding skills. 
                            Just like anything else that I do, I always put in 100% effort in all of my projects. 
                            To me, no project is less significant, because there is no single solution for a coding challenge. I can always learn something from exploring different approaches. </p>

                <p>Since I was 10, I have been into drawing and designing. I could for hours sketching on paper or editing my blog and videos. 
                Dreamt to be a designer, yet, the destiny led into studying economics and business for all my years of education. 
                <br><br>Back in 2017, I was working in marketing data management team at Bosch, Singapore. In 2019, I moved back to Australia and started to work as a resourcing specialist at Programmed Skilled Workforce.
                My love for technology and the confidence working with systems gradually grew throughout years of performing database management and data analysis. At the end of the day, I still found the job was not challenging enough and that I was missing my childhood passion.
                <br><br>In 2020, I had my first child. Being a mother gives me more strength and motivation to build myself a career that is both stable and flexible enough to achieve work-life balance.
                <br><br>I then took my courage and leapt into the new found passion - <strong><em>coding</em></strong>.
                I love combining the worlds of logic and creative design to make engaging, functional and accessible digital products. I find genuine happiness when I am able to build a website, a program or an application from the scratch.
                <br><br> Here's a saying from Maya Angelou that has been with me through thicks and thins. Switching to a new career with a family to look after is definitely not easy but I believe that as long as you put your heart in whatever you do, work hard and never give up, you will get rewarded with fruitful outcome.
                <br><br> I truly hope one day I can inspire and encourage young mothers to take the leap and get educated in this fast-changing world of technology. And that would be my dream come true when my kids proudly say that "My mom is a coder".
